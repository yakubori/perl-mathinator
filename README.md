## Purpose

Examples of OO in Perl using a simple class which represents and performs some mathematical
functions on an integer.

I think they are a bit more interesting than the typical Person/Animal examples. :)

## Represented OO Options

So far, there are examples of:

* Standard, out-of-the-box OO in Perl
* Moo (not the same as Moose)

## Bonus

The examples use memoization as well, via the (core) Memoize module. It is not a requirement,
but it's there to expose the functionality.
